# Haskell-coursework
These are the source files and test files that I created for the test-driven development case study I did in my third year of university.

More specifically any code files in the "cwk2code" folder were done for the coursework. The code in the "linkedlist" folder was done outside of the coursework in my own time

The code in the "cwk2code" folder was awarded an exceptional 1st mark. 

The code projects in the repo were created and tested using ghcup. The folders can be downloaded and then run and tested with ghci.
